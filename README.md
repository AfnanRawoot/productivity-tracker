# Daily Goals App

A minimal daily goals / task manager built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to manage daily tasks with priority marking and persistent storage using `localStorage`.



## Features

- Add daily goals with optional details
- Mark goals as important (IMP)
- Remove completed goals
- Data persistence using browser localStorage
- Multiple UI themes (Default, Morning, Evening, Night)
- Clean card-based layout



## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (CSS Variables for theming)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation & Events)
- localStorage API


## How It Works

- Goals are stored locally in the browser
- On page load, saved goals are rendered automatically
- Each goal is displayed as a card
- Important goals show an IMP badge
- Clicking **Mark As Done** removes the goal
